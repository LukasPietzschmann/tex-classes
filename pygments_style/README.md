# Pygments Style

If you wanna make your minted listings use the same colors as the TeX classes in this repo, you have to install this package.
This can be done by executing `pip install .` inside this directory. You can then check the output of `pygmentize -L styles`
to verify that the style called `awesome` was actually installed.

If you run into problems the [pygments website](https://pygments.org/docs/plugins/) may have you covered. Feel free to issue-spam
me otherwise ;)
