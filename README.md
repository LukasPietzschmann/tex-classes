This is my little (and hopefully growing) collection of TeX classes I use.

## exercise
### Options
This class provides some settings you can tweak:
- Language: Possible values are `english` or `german`. This changes the value passed to babel and csquotes. If none of both is selected, `german` is used.
- uulm: You can set this flag if you're studying at the University of Ulm. This puts the university's logo in the top right corner.
